#Attempt at microcosm programming for the sake of later inclusion
#in the overall model

#first need to identify st1, st2, st3
#cannot take as given
#need to calculate additional terms
#Beta is given by A.bar

#Does gamma come in anywhere under a different name?
#Lecture slides use S and ν for IW values as well as M, Σ, P
#Paper uses ψ and d for IW values as well as b, Σ, Ω

#Directions to derive St seem unclear
#Theta is (s1, s2, s3, rho)
#is it just p(gamma, theta|y)
#But how is p(y|gamma, theta) derived?
#IT seems to depend on already having st
#Does it mean the prior of st? 

#set new yt based on given st
#curent y lacks date
#rebind date to verify
#There must be a better way to select the appropriate dates
#I just don't know offhand
